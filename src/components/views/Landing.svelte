              Nostrocket uses Bitcoin and THE NOSTR to coordinate leaderless and
              location-independent Bitcoin-based economies that sustainably
              reward productive solutions to shared problems facing humanity.

              This economic tool allows contributors to stop fiat mining and
              follow their passion in a way that directly contributes to an
              improvement in the human condition for themselves and all of
              humanity by solving problems in the critical path towards a
              Bitcoin standard with nostr as humanity’s social graph.

            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
              Participants use their nostr identity to log problems (observed
              matters or situations regarded as unsatisfactory) in a global
              problem tree starting with the root problem: <a
                href="{base}/problems/3b8e916d6b681363405fe6c493445403220fa4c41b737b6a78a8e2482a16fc18"
                >Humanity is not living up to its full potential.</a
              >
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Problems become broken down into leaf nodes that are granular and
              solveable, e.g. “this button doesn’t work”. Any participant may
              then claim and solve it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Once solved, a merit request may be proposed by the solver for an
              amount of merits that reflects their work; all participants may
              vote (in proportion to the merits they have) to approve or reject
              the merit request. If approved, the merit pool is diluted by the
              solver’s new merits. Merits are the canonical representation of
              the total value of all contributions to a Rocket.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When the aggregate result of many small problems/solutions yields
              a useful product or service that earns revenue in the free market
              (read more about how this works at nostrocket.org), the payments
              for these products/services go directly to merit holders via their
              Bitcoin or Lightning addresses (in proportion to their merits).
              There’s no middle man as in legacy organisations, your work
              rewards you directly if the project is beneficial to others.
              Nostrocket is totally non-custodial and itself holds no value.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Another critical aspect of Nostrocket is different
              localities/communities/ideologies may fork off their own Rocket
              based on a branch of the problem tree. This becomes a separate
              Rocket with a separate merit pool, but it can be merged back into
              its parent Rocket at any time, giving humanity the flexibility to
              create citadel economies or participate in the global Nostrocket
              economy (which is the top level Rocket).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Critically, the direction of a Rocket is not incentivised by
              upfront capital raising or Cantillon power structures.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              A Nostrocket client validates nostr events against the Nostrocket
              Unprotocol and facilitates interaction with the Unprotocol through
              your nostr identity. The state of Nostrocket exists entirely as
              nostr events. The merkle root of Nostrocket state may be
              checkpointed to the Bitcoin timechain by any merit-holder at any
              time.
